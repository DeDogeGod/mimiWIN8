### How to use
In the payloads txt file their should be a bunch of comments. Replace the delays acording to your machine. Mine was a lenovo yoga to 64 bit slowed down. Also you have to make a switch position by your self and make it change the attack mode the storage then plug it in your target. After the content of the usb pops on the target computer plug it out then run the payload I included. You do this so the usb pop up screen doesnt stop the process. Thats why I made a rubber ducky version to fix this issue. Although you can do this with a bash bunny to the rubber ducky doesnt need to boot up making it way more faster.You can fix the usb pop up issue by using two diffrent usbs. You pluf your storage usb in first and right plug in the bash bunny next. That way the bash bunny will boot up after the usb pops up on the computer. You can do this much faster with a rubber ducky becuase you can use hid storage. This way you can use two usbs at the same time and the computer wont pop up that usb thing. Bash bunny has hid storage to but it also has that boot up time sooooooooo... Rubber ducky is faster.
